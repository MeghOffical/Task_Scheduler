### **Elicitation Techniques Used**

1. **Stakeholder Analysis** – Identify all people who use or influence the system; ensures relevant functional and non-functional requirements are captured.

2. **Interviews** – Direct discussions with users or stakeholders to gather detailed needs, expectations, and pain points for both FRs and NFRs.

3. **Task Observation** – Watch users perform their tasks to understand workflows and identify requirements the users may not explicitly state.

4. **Questionnaires / Surveys** – Collect structured feedback from a broader audience to quantify needs like usability, performance, or preferences.

5. **Prototyping** – Build simple versions of the system to validate functionality, UI, and performance; helps elicit hidden requirements and refine design.

6. **Power-user Feedback** – Gain insights from experienced or frequent users to capture advanced or edge-case requirements.

7. **Project Vision / Documentation Review** – Study existing documents, project roadmaps, or PDFs to extract functional and non-functional expectations.

8. **Risk Analysis** – Identify potential failures, security issues, or data loss scenarios to define reliability, privacy, and safety requirements.

9. **Use Cases** – Describe typical system interactions to derive performance, workflow, and usability needs.

10. **Brainstorming** – Generate ideas for maintainability, extensibility, future features, and advanced NFR considerations.

11. **Competitive Analysis** – Study similar systems to benchmark performance, usability, and features.
