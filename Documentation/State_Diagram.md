## Sprint 1: Initial login screen and basic account setup

This sprint was all about building the **first screen** (the Login page) and setting up the **basic rules** for how users sign in. This is the **foundation** for the rest of the app.

## Key Features Implemented

* **Login Screen Ready:** The sign-in page is finished. It looks good on phones and computers, and it's easy to use.
* **Sign-in Works:** We put in the code to check the email and password when you click 'Login' (right now it just checks against test accounts, the real connection comes next).
* **Google Button:** The **"Sign in with Google" button** is on the page. It doesn't connect yet, but the spot for the code is ready.
* **Link Navigation:** Clicking the **"Register"** or **"Forgot Password?"** links takes you to the right place.
* **App Style Started:** We locked down the basic look and feel of the app: the colors (like the main blue), the fonts, and the way the boxes (the login card) are centered.

## Success Criteria

The app now **opens to the Login page**, accepts text in the fields, and shows a message (success or error) when you try to log in. We're ready to start building the rest of the features!

## Sprint 2: Task Management 

In this sprint, we made it easy for users to track their task progress accurately and utilize the focused work cycle (Pomodoro).

### Key Implemented Features

* **Task Status Management:** Users can update a task's status to **'In Progress,' 'Completed,'** or **'Pending'** to accurately track its state.
* **Task Prioritization:** Ability to assign and display **High, Medium, or Low Priority** to tasks, aiding user focus.
* **Task Editing:** Comprehensive interface for **editing existing task details** (title, dates, priority) with immediate reflection on the dashboard.
* **Pomodoro Timer Integration:** A dedicated feature allowing users to initiate a focused **25-minute work / 5-minute break** cycle.
